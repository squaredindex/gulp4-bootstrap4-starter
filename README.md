# Gulp 4 Starter
This is a basic starting point to for a project using Gulp 4. Nothing fancy just compling SCSS and watching file changes
to update the browser.

## Configuration References:

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Gulp v4 - Sass and BrowserSync setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgMQeLymAdU)


## Getting Started:

1. Check you have both Node and NPM Installed with `node -v` & `npm -v`
2. Check if you have Gulp installed with `gulp -v`. If not then use the command: `npm install gulp-cli -g` to install it globally.
3. Run `npm install --save-dev`.
4. Run `gulp watch` and edit/save a file to see the changes update.
